# cpp-real-world-problems
This repository contains real-world and logic-based C++ programs that simulate practical systems such as ATM machines, electricity billing, exam result processing 
and other application-oriented problems. And these are achieved by using core c++ concepts such as if-else-if-else ladder, arrays etc...
## Focus Areas
- Problem solving
- Real-world logic implementation
- Clean and readable C++ code
